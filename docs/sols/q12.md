#### This is a simple problem in Combinatronics.

Think of 11 slots, with 4 possible entries. So, we have a superset of 4<sup>11</sup> combinations.  
We can see that it takes **6 steps up** and **3 steps right** to reach ***(4,7)*** from ***(1,1)***, in any order.  
So, we have to arrange 6 and 3 into 9 slots.  
Also, the other 2 (we need 11 steps precisely) steps will be all pairs of counter-steps (CS), namely:  
**CS:{(up,down),(down,up),(left,right),(right,left)}**.  
At the end, it reduces to this problem:  
In 11 slots, add 3 of A, 6 of B and 1(2, since CS is a pair of steps) out of CS.

We can reduce it to a problem of re-arranging the letters in a word:<br>
  Rearrange "UUUUUURRRLR" into all possible words, and<br>
  Rearrange "UUUUUURRRDU" into all possible words.<br>
  We notice in first case, the possible arrangements are `11!/(6!4!1!0!)`<br>
  and, in the second case, the possible arrangements are `11!/(7!3!0!1!)`<br>
  (considering U:up, D:down, L:left and R:right).<br>
  Hence, the final answer is: 1320+2310 = 3630.
#### Easy! Done!!!
