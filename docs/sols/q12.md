### Solution
#### This is a simple problem in Combinatronics.
Think of 11 slots, with 4 possible entries. So, we have a superset of 4<sup>11</sup> combinations.  
We can see that it takes **6 steps up** and **3 steps left** to reach ***(4,7)*** from ***(1,1)***, in any order.  So, we have to arrange 6 and 3 into 9 slots.  
Also, the other 2 (we need 11 steps precisely) steps will be all pairs of counter-steps, namely: **CS:{(up,down),(down,up),(left,right),(right,left)}**.  
At the end, it reduces to this problem:  
In 11 slots, add 3 of A, 6 of B and 1(2, since CS is a pair of steps) out of CS.
#### Easy! Done :partying:
(Numerical solution will be posted only after the time's :up:!)
